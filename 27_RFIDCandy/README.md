# General info

With this fun little project you get a RFID candy dispenser that regulates your candy consumption. Perfect if you always empty the box in no time!


## Hardware
- For this project we used an ESP32 D1 mini and a RC522 RFID module.
- We have realized the rotating mechanism with a slightly stronger stepper motor NEMA17.
- We used the stepper driver A4988
- For voltage regulation between 12 and 3.3 volts we used a LD33V voltage regulator.
- And we added a 100µF capacitor for the motor.
