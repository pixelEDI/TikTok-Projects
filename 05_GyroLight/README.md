# General info

In this fun little project we made a LED cube that changes colours when you turn it to another side. 

## Hardware
- The ESP32 is our microcontroller of choice for this LED cube. 
- For the LEDs, we used a couple of WS2812b single LEDs and created a pattern that fitted perfectly into the cube. 
- For the rotating mechanism we used a three-axis gyroscope. 
- We also added a voltage transformer, so we can power the light with a regular power supply.
