# General info

We have built an electronic safe that can be opened with an RFID tag. As soon as the safe is unlocked, you receive a notification via MQTT to your email address. 
If you try to open the safe with an incorrect RFID tag, a red LED lights up. 

## Hardware
- The ESP32 is our microcontroller of choice for this homemade electronic safe. 
- For the locking mechanism, we added an MG996R servo motor controlled by an RFID module.
- We added a 220 Î© resistor for the red LED and a WS2812B LED strip for the interior lighting.
- We also added a voltage transformer, so we can power the safe with a regular power supply.
