# General info

In this code we get sensor data from a flame sensor. When the fire approaches, a yellow LED lights up. 
When the fire is too close, a small fan is switched on by a relay, which blows out the fire. 

## Hardware
- For this project we used an Arduino Uno.
- We added three 220 Î© resistors for the three LEDs.
- We used the ALLNET 4duino flame sensor for fire detection.
- We took a KY-019 relay to switch the 3 V DC motor on and off.
