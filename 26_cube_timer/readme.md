I would like to improve my Rubik's Cube solving time.
Therefore I created a simpole IoT stopwatch.

## Hardware
* ESP32 XIAO
* RP-S40-ST High precision thin film pressure sensor
* Button and 0,96 OLED Display

I had a thin film pressure sensor left over and thought it would be perfect for a stopwatch. 
The time is sent via MQTT to Node-RED and saved in MariaDB.
